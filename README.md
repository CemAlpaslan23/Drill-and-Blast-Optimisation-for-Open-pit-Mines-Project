# Drill-and-Blast-Optimisation-for-Open-pit-Mines-Project

- Analysed and extended an existing drill-and-blast optimisation article called “Drill Pattern Optimisation for Large Complex Blasts to Improve Fragmentation and Dig Efficiency” by formulating a large-scale non-linear mathematical model incorporating fragmentation-based objective functions and operational constraint.
  
- Modelled complex open-pit bench characteristics including blast geometry, explosive parameters, and rock mass variability to realistically represent industrial drilling and blasting conditions.
  
- Designed a synthetic data generation algorithm to simulate bench geometry, spatial hardness distributions, and blast hole configurations, enabling scalable and controlled computational experiments.
  
- Developed an adaptive Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) metaheuristic with dynamic parameter tuning and restart mechanisms to efficiently solve the established non-linear mathematical model.

- Achieved up to 13.7% improvement in total fragmentation objective and 12.8% reduction in maximum fragmentation ratio objective, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed optimisation methodology.
